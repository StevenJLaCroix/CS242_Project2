### Project Description
The goal of this project was to take preprocessed data collected from Fitbits for a number of users and draw conclusions about what leads to calorie burn, as well as some other things. Skills used were data processing, visualization, and t-tests. There were 4 main focus points for this project. Those were: distributions & outliers, data processing, correlation and plots, and t-tests. A range of techniques were used to find correlation between difference variables and eventually test for significance between them.
